The method allocates a number of points to each participant based on placing, with first place always receiving 100 points and last place receiving 0.

P=100×((1-log⁡x)/log⁡n )

P= x/n = probability of achieving a rank equal to or better than x
n = Number of Competitors
x = Rank (ordinal placing of competitor)
